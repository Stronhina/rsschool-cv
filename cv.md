###About me
----------
- I am a physic-engineer. I worked as lotus developer long time. When I had parental leave I decided changed specialization and began to study web-development. I don’t have big practical experience in this field, but I have high motivation, learn quickly and I am really ready to work hard. My education gave me great theoretical base and skill to study new technologies in short time. I am fond of web-development, because there is important to use not only technical tools but to be creative and to pay attention to detail.
- Responsible, have an analytical mind, diligence, able achieve set aims and believe that dreams come true.
- I am married, I have son Leo (5 years old).
